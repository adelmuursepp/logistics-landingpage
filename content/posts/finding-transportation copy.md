# CL (Heathrow)

CL started business in 2014 and have used Cafs since their first day. 
For them the cost savings of using cloud software were a great advantage as there was no initial purchase of hardware needed. 


As with all start-ups, they do not always know exactly which direction their business will go in. 
Very often clients have asked them to handle work which was profitable but needed specialist documentation which Cafs could provide for them without having to purchase additional modules. 


Cafs has its own track and trace website included, which in many systems is at an additional cost. CL-s biggest customer made use of this from the beginning and significantly reduced administration time by CL staff leaving them free to work for growing the business. 


Eight years on CL continue to work with us in developing additional features that helped to make Cafs a great system for any courier or freight forwarder.
