# West House Transport

1997 West House Transport were given just two weeks to build a system which integrated with their biggest customer Avon Cosmetics, who delivered hundreds of thousands of shipments every week and demanded that West House integrated to their system due to a sudden change in policy. 


The finance manager at West House was very concerned that this had to be done so quickly given that there were 17 offices in the group across the UK and in those days there was almost no internet. 


Due to RGP-s extensive experience in the transport industry it was possible to adapt the existing CAFS system to Avon's requirements. 


In 25 years despite robberies, fire and theft there has never been a day when every office was not able to operate.
